This GitHub project is a microservices-based application designed to manage companies, their spaces, and employees. The main objective of this project is to provide a scalable and modular solution for companies to efficiently organize their resources and streamline communication among employees.

## Technologies used :
### - Project Archetecture : 
1. **Microservices** : This project follows a microservices architecture, where software applications are developed as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other. It consists of two main microservices: the [Employees Service](employeeService), responsible for managing employees and facilitating communication between them, and the [CompanyUnits Service](companyArchitectureService), which focuses on managing company units.  


### - Backend :
1. **Spring Boot** : Spring Boot is a powerful framework that simplifies the development of Java applications. It provides a streamlined platform for building stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications with minimal configuration.
2. **Spring Security** : Spring Security is a widely-used framework for adding authentication and authorization capabilities to your applications. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and APIs to secure your microservices, including features like user authentication, role-based access control, and protection against common security vulnerabilities. 
3. **Spring Cloud** : 
4. **Spring Data Jpa(Implementation: Hibernate)** : Spring Data JPA is a part of the Spring Data project that simplifies working with relational databases in Java applications
