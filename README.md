# My_Company

## Description :
This GitHub project is a microservices-based application designed to manage companies, their spaces, and employees. The main objective of this project is to provide a scalable and modular solution for companies to efficiently organize their resources and streamline communication among employees.

## Technologies used :
### - Project Archetecture : 
1. **Microservices** : This project follows a microservices architecture, where software applications are developed as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other. It consists of two main microservices: the [Employees Service](employeeService), responsible for managing employees and facilitating communication between them, and the [CompanyUnits Service](companyArchitectureService), which focuses on managing company units.  


### - Backend :
1. **Spring Boot** : In this project, I leveraged the power of Spring Boot, a robust framework that greatly simplifies Java application development. By utilizing Spring Boot as the backend framework.
2. **Spring Security** : Spring Security is a widely-used framework for adding authentication and authorization capabilities to your applications. I used it to secure my microservices.
3. **Spring Cloud** :  Spring Cloud is a framework that helps developers build and deploy scalable, distributed systems. It provides a set of tools and libraries for implementing common patterns and building blocks required for microservices architecture .such as service discovery and Api gateway which i used in this project .
4. **Spring Data Jpa(Implementation: Hibernate)** : Spring Data JPA is a part of the Spring Data project that simplifies working with relational databases in Java applications .


### - Front-End :
1. **Angular** : Angular is a JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications.
2. **TypeScript** : TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript.
3. **Tailwind** : Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a collection of pre-built CSS classes


### - Api(Communication between Front-end and Back-end) :
1. **WebSockets** : WebSockets is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex, real-time communication between a client (usually a web browser) and a server. And by using this protocol i created the chat between the employees .
2. **Rest Api** : REST (Representational State Transfer) API is an architectural style for designing networked applications.

### - Communication between microservices :
1. **Kafka** :
2. **WebClient** :
